# pythonForFinance_Munroe
Small/Mini Projects that I have done while learning Python at the University of Utah

Things from learning strings to creating an algorithmic stock trading function based on a fake set of clients pulled from
a CSV File.

Also displays some data visualization practice and remotely downloading data from online (similar to ETL Pipelines)
